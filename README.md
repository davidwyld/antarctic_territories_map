# Antarctic Territories Map

Made for day 7 of the 2025 [30 day map challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com), for which the theme was "accessibility"

As with all of my entries in this, my first attempt at doing some intensive mapping, this was made with little experience.

* Made using [leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com)
* Antarctic Territories Data from: https://researchdata.edu.au/antarctic-territorial-claims-gis/700978
* Data processed using GeoPandas.
